// Questions for you:
// 1. I know you asked for these events, please do let me know if you need more
// 2. The type of information these handlers will tell you, right now i have a void pointer, i looked at the cc2420 interface briefly but couldn't quite
//    figure out enough information about what is needed.
// 3. You are obviously free to change the names of these handlers, this is just an example, as long as you are passing an object of IRadioInterface to the Radio_AddHandlers
//   function with the same signature you are fine. The first eventhandler is signalling an SFD event and the second signals an EFD
