Quick(ish) Installation of Samraksh Dev Enviornment
=================================================
Written on Feb 17, 2015.


Note 1: As of Feb 2017 VS 2013 is still need for compiling v4.3, but VS 2012 Express is not needed anymore
Note 1.5: If you have VS 2015 or 2017 edition its ok. VS 2013 can be installed along with them.
Note 2: MF 4.3 porting kit installation is not needed anymore

- Everything you need is in Dropbox at Dropbox(Samraksh)/Dev eMote/MF432/
- Install Visual Studio Community Edition 2013, exe is available in dropbox
- Install VS2013 update 5, exe is available in dropbox 
- Install MF 4.3 SDK, found in dropbox
- Checkout Samraksh MF repo
- Checkout Samraksh TestSystem repo

- Find out the highest compiler version dir from TestSystem\Compiler directory.
- Go the MF\MicroFrameworkPK_v4_3\ dir

- Run 
> setenv_gcc.cmd compiler_version compiler_dir

The above command should finish without any error or warning. If it complains about VS or VC++ missing, then something is wrong.

You are all set to compile the Emote solutions. Compile using

> msbuild /t:clean /maxcpucount /p:memory=FLASH,flavor=release tinyclr.proj
> msbuild /t:build /maxcpucount /p:memory=FLASH,flavor=release tinyclr.proj
