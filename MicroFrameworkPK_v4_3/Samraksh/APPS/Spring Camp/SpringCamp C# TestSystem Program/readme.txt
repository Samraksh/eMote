This program was originally modified from the ADC dual callback test.
With the spring camp firmware disabling the serial port this program was modified to be the entirety of the Spring Camp C# app. With this code the TestSystem can be used to compile TinyBooter, TinyCLR and the C# Spring Camp app all at once and load it up via JTAG.
