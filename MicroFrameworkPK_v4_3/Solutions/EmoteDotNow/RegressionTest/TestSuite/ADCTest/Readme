Description
===========
	The Timer test initially starts of by rising pin1 of the gpio to indicate the start of the test. The timer is initialized
in a default mode as used by the microframework. Other modes can be tested using the same test. The physical timer that is tested
is timer3. Other timers can also be tested by changing the parameter to the intialize. The intialize function also registers an
interrupt handler with the interrupt controller. This test therefore also exercises the INTC registration functionality. The SetCompare 
function sets a compare value on the compare register and toggles a pin in the interrupt handler. The pin should toggle at a time period defined by 
the value in the compare function.
