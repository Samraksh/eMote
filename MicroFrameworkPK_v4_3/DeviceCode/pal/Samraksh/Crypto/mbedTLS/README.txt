This directory contains opensource code from the mbed-TLS project. Look at the following link for details https://tls.mbed.org/

The code is from the 2.4.2 release of the mbded-tls, but we compile only files that we need, not the entire project.

The code under here is under apache 2 license and hence should be ok for commercial use, but do not modify the code, unless you know what you are doing.
