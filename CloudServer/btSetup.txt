#This is client side
#First create a BT channel for serial profile
sudo sdptool add --channel=1 SP

#next create a device for use for rfcomm
sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/rfcomm0 c 216 0

#next try to connect to the service device and connect the connection to the serial device
rfcomm connect /dev/rfcomm0 [SERVER_ADDR] 1

#alternately if you have setup /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf like this

#rfcomm0 {
#        bind no;
#        device 98:07:2D:37:DF:9B;
#        channel 1;
#        comment "Samraksh IoT device";
#}


#then you can just issue
#sudo rfcomm connect 1
