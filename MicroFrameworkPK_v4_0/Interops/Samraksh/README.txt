This folder contains the interops responsible for bridging the C# and native code of the datastore.

To add this to the existing microframework code replace the current interops folder under 

- C:\MicroFrameworkPK_v4_0\Interops with this one. 

The new files that have been added as a part of this interop include.

InterfaceLibrary_Samraksh_Memory.cpp
InterfaceLibrary_Samraksh_Memory.h
InterfaceLibrary_Samraksh_Memory_mshl.cpp

These provide the interface to the datastore instance.
