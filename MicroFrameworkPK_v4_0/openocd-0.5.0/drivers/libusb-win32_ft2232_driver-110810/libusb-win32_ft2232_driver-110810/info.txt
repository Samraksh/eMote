WHY LIBUSB-WIN32 DRIVERS?
_________________________

Since June/July of 2009 due to alleged GPL license violation OpenOCD cannot be
distributed with support for ftd2xx library. That's why FT2232 JTAGs have to be
used via libusb-win32 drivers, and OpenOCD will be linked with libftdi library.
Because of that OpenOCD users have to use different JTAG drivers. This small
document provides a basic "how to" of libusb-win32 drivers for FT2232 based
JTAGs. Users who need OpenOCD linked with ftd2xx library can build the software
from sources.

USAGE INFO
__________

FT2232 is an USB Composite Device, so from the system's point of view it is seen
as two completely separate devices which can have two completely
separate drivers.

Devices which have only JTAG (Amontec JTAGkey, Olimex ARM-USB-TINY, etc.) should
use libusb-win32 drivers for BOTH FT2232 sub-devices - no additional drivers are
required. In those devices the second channel is unused.

Devices which have JTAG and UART/RS-232 on board (egnite Turtelizer 2, Olimex
ARM-USB-OCD, etc.) should use libusb-win32 drivers only for the JTAG channel.
The UART/RS-232 port needs drivers from FTDI, most likely with modified VID/PID
combination - such drivers should be provided by the JTAG vendor.

DRIVER INSTALLATION
___________________

Start with plugging your JTAG adapter to an USB port. If no drivers were
installed the install wizard will pop-up automatically. If ftd2xx drivers were
installed earlier, you should invoke the wizard manually - open the Device
Manager (Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager), right click on the
JTAG device (in "Universal Serial Bus controllers" group) and select Update
Driver. During the installation don't use automatic methods (this may install
wrong drivers) - use "Don't search. I will choose the driver to install" (fully
manual mode) instead. Succesfully installed driver(s) will be displayed in the
"libusb-win32 devices" group in the Device Manager.
